#### What does it do?

`kommit.rb` is a simple CLI tool that allows you to create an arbitrary amount of git commits dating back to an arbitrary date in the past which can result in a completly changed commit history on a user's GitHub profile page. Users answer a few questions and `kommit.rb` does the rest.

#### How does it work?

`kommit.rb` uses the GitHub CLI to create a private repository in the user's home directory. Based on the user's input it then creates a certain amount of commits for a certain amount of days back in the past and then pushes them to GitHub all at once.

#### Reverting changes

As `kommit.rb` uses a private repository reverting all commits is as simple as deleting the repository on GitHub.
